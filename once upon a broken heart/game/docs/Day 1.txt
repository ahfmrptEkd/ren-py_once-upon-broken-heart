NARRATOR: You approach a cathedral in the abandoned Temple District of Valenda. People used to come to worship at the Fated churches, but all you can see now are buildings and streets long forgotten. As you step into the The Prince of Hearts’ church, you are reminded of the warning your mother always told you: Never make a bargain with a Fate. As you approach the altar to pray, you notice a young man in the corner. Everything from his clothes to his hair is disheveled. You begin to whisper your prayers, but you can feel the man watching you.

NARRATOR: Three broken-heart shaped scars appear on your wrists sealing the deal you’ve made with the Fate. You find yourself standing alone in the cathedral and you get the eerie feeling that you bargained away something you can’t get back.
