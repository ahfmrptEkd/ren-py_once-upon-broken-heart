1) A Shattered Dream: Our fairytale ends with a simple fracture?imperceptible until it causes the entire story to collapse. I'm nowhere to be found when the pieces need picking up. You're left in a realm of eternal longing, haunted by melodies of what might have been, shadows dancing where truths used to stand.

2) Death of the Heart: As fate would have it, the heart I stole simply ceases to beat, devoid of inspiration from my erstwhile charm. It's a quiet death?a peaceful dissolution into nothingness as if your very essence had merged with silence. Perhaps your heart was weak, needing constant tending, or perhaps it was I who strangled it slowly.

3) The Blinding Revelation: The veil lifts, revealing my villainy in its raw, unfiltered state. You see the monster I've always been. I grant you freedom?a cruel joke, as you realize that all along, you were captivated not by love, but by a venomous enchantment. The world outside my shadow is harsh and unforgiving, and you must navigate it without my guiding hand.
