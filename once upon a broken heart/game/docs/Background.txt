Set in the Meridian Empire?a magical and fairy-tale-esque world. 
Specifically the city of Valenda?the capital of the empire.
The city of Valenda was said to have been built by the Fates and their magic. 
The Fates are demigod-like beings who once ruled the world. They were then trapped into a deck of tarot cards known as the “Deck of Destiny”. 
However, they have recently been freed from their prison. Each Fate has magical powers and a curse matching their greatest weakness.
Jacks is a Fate known as “The Prince of Hearts”. 
He is said to have a kiss worth dying for. He can control people’s heartbeats and emotions. 
His kiss is lethal to everyone except his true love.
The story begins with the broken-hearted you seeking The Prince of Hearts out for help in his church in the temple district.
