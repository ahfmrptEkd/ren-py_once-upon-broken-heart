Narrator: You feel a cold breeze on your shoulders and suddenly you are back in your own room. You look around for Jacks, but he is nowhere to be found. As you make your way to your bed, you spot an apple on your pillow. Upon further inspection, you find a note. “Are you prepared for what lies ahead, Little Fox? For the next time we meet, our true adventure will begins.”
